The html can be found at [/templates/index.html](https://github.com/Osgboy/BBCalculator/blob/main/templates/index.html).\
All the icons, preset jsons, and most of the Javascript and CSS are in [/static/](https://github.com/Osgboy/BBCalculator/tree/main/static).\
The (modified) calculator Python script itself is at [/calculator/BBCalc.py](https://github.com/Osgboy/BBCalculator/blob/main/calculator/BBCalc.py).\
The rest of the important backend code is at [/calculator/views.py](https://github.com/Osgboy/BBCalculator/blob/main/calculator/views.py).
